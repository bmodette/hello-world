# hello-world
Just another repository
I constantly feel overwhelmed in this field. I feel I am not doing enough work to further myself. I feel like I should have accomplished so much more by this point. I've forgotten a lot of what I have learned and honestly feel like this might not be for me. I am constantly thinking about how much of a failure I may be and cry every time I work on computer code. I want to enjoy it, but something is preventing me from fully embracing coding. Maybe it's not for me.
